\section{Introduction}
As part of NEUP-FY16-10512 (PI: Dr. Kathryn Huff), a test-run of fuel cycle
transition scenarios was done using \Cyclus. The purpose of this study
is to identify the non-algorithmic capability gaps necessary for a complete simulation.
The fuel cycle models are from the Idaho National Laboratory Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Report
(Hereby E\&S Report) \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}. The transition scenarios begin with EG01 and transitions to EG23, EG24, EG29, EG30,
separately. The descriptions of each fuel cycle is in \cref{tab:es}.

\section{Simulation Specifics}
The transition scenarios in this study follows a common set of base-case parameters and assumptions,
adapted by the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign \cite{djokic_application_2015}.
% Need to list them?

The reactor specifications (mass of core, batch, refueling cycle) follows
the specifications given by the E\&S report appendix B \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.

For the compositions of the fresh and spent fuels, various models give different answers.
As it will be discussed later, the recipe (more specifically the Breeding Ratio of the \gls{SFR}),
plays an extremely crucial role in the rapidity and success of the transition. 

With that being said,the swiftness of the transition greatly depends on the 
breeding ratio of the \gls{SFR} since new \glspl{SFR} cannot be deployed 
without a sufficient fissile inventory. 

\subsection{Important Parameters}
For a successful transition, there must be enough fissile materials in store prior to transition
to start new advanced reactors. Also, enough surplus fissile materials have to be produced
during the transition to support the start of new reactors.

To satisfy such conditions, the important simulation parameters identified are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Breeding Ratio of \gls{SFR}
	\item Deployment Scheme (Transition initiating time, Transition sharpness)
	\item Reprocessing and Fabrication Throughput and Buffer
\end{enumerate}


This is assuming that the following parameters are fixed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reactor Specifics (core size, refueling cycle, power)
	\item Separation Efficiency
	\item Increase Rate of Power Demand
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Recipes}
The reactor archetype in \Cycamore uses recipes to do depletion calculations,
where the spent fuel composition is user-defined and constant. 

The recipe from appendix B of the E\&S report does not take into account
additional deployment of reactors from increased power demand (In other words, the Breeding Ratio
of \glspl{SFR} in the appendix are low), which means that there is no (or very little)
extra fissile material (Pu or TRU) produced. For EG23 and EG24, the Breeding Ratios are
a little over breakeven (~1.01), which makes deployment of additional reactors solely 
dependent on fissile material inventory from legacy LWR \gls{UNF}. For EG29 and EG30,
the Breeding Ratios are big higher (~1.29 and 1.05, respectively) to feed the
\gls{MOX} \glspl{LWR}, but still does not accumulate fissile material inventory for
additional reactor deployment.

To solve this problem, an ORIGEN-generated depletion recipe is used. This recipe
has a fresh fuel plutonium composition of 12.9\%, and a BR of $1.16$. This breeding
ratio allows complete SFR transition in 2170 for EG23 and EG24. For the EG29 and EG30,
the BRs have to be higher to feed the \gls{MOX} \glspl{LWR}. 


\section{Gaps}
The test-runs with \Cyclus and \Cycamore allowed identifications of various non-algorithmic gaps
of the current \Cycamore archetypes as well as the \Cyclus material exchange model.

\subsection{Critical Gaps}
Critical gaps are defined as gaps that, if not fixed, will not allow a complete transition,
or provide a completely erroneous solution.

\subsubsection{Throughput of fuel cycle facilities}
The throughput and capacity values of fuel cycle support facilities, such as fuel fabrication plant
(\textsc{FuelFab}\xspace, \textsc{Mixer}\xspace) need to adjust according to demand. In EG23 and EG24,
there is one archetype that receives separated fissile materials. In this case, a reprocessing
plant or a fuel fab plant can have infinite buffer/throughput because it is the only
archetype with the demand for that commodity. However, EG29 and EG30 has two archetypes
that compete for the fissile materials (ie. \gls{MOX} fuel fab competes with \gls{SFR} fuel fab for separated plutonium).
In this case, if both fabrication plants have infinite buffer/throughput, one fabrication takes all the
separated fissile material, leaving the other plant debilitated. This comes from the \Cyclus greedy exchange,
where if there isn't enough supply for all demands, the bigger demand gets filled first. 


\Cref{fig:mox} and \cref{fig:sfr} plot the fuel demand of \gls{MOX} \glspl{LWR} and \glspl{SFR},
respectively, in an EG29 scenario.

A fix for this could be to have a dynamic throughput that adjusts according
to predicted fuel demand, or, more realistically, have an archetype with fixed, reasonable, throughput/buffer
that is deployed when there is fuel demand beyond its predicted throughput.

\subsubsection{Irresponsible deployment}
The \textsc{DeployInst}\xspace model deploys prototypes in a user-defined time period, even though there is not 
enough fuel to operate the reactor. The deployed reactor is deployed, but remains idle. 

\subsection{Improvement}
The following concepts are, if improved upon, would allow for more accurate modeling of
transition of fuel cycle.

\subsubsection{Dynamic parameters}
The various parameters for \Cyclus archetypes are static except for the \Cycamore \textsc{Reactor}\xspace
where the incoming and outgoing recipe and commodity can be changed. A dynamic parameter would be able
to better accommodate the fluctuating fuel demand. The throughput can be adjusted in many different ways:
from predicted fuel demand from simulation, a function of installed power capacity, a function of time, etc.

\subsubsection{Blanket capability for \textsc{Reactor}\xspace}
For \glspl{SFR}, the blanket and the driver have different effective fuel residence times, meaning that
they should (ideally) be handled separately. However, with current capabilities, the option is the average
the mass and composition of driver and blanket to treat is as one commodity.

\subsubsection{Depletion Calculations}
Depletion calculations are done outside of the simulation. However, if models like \textsc{Cyborg}\xspace
or \textsc{Bright-Lite}\xspace are utilized, there could be more accurate depletion calculations and 
perhaps dynamic Breeding Ratio modeling.

\subsubsection{\textsc{Reactor}\xspace Decommissioning Behavior}
The \Cycamore \textsc{Reactor}\xspace, when decommissioned mid-cycle, supposedly transmutes half of
its current assemblies (I tried and it transmuted all, and discharges all). An alternative would
be to have recipes for each stage (ie. for four batch, there would be three spent fuel recipes).
